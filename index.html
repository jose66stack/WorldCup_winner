            France won the tournament after a gap of 20 years, defeating Croatia 4-2 in the final held at the Luznikhi Stadium in Moscow. Didier Deschamps had the honour of doing a rare double. Deschamps was the captain when France won the World Cup in 1998 and 20 years later, the Frenchman was the toast of the nation after coaching the Les Bleus to World Cup glory. It was the 11th time that the World Cup was being held in Europe.

            Germany ended their World Cup drought with a 1-0 win over Argentina in the final which went to the extra time with Mario Goetze netting the all-important winner at the Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro. But the most poignant memory of the World Cup will remain the hosts' crushing 1-7 loss to the eventual champions in the semifinal at Belo Horizonte. The match was as good as the 29th minute by which Germany had pumped in five goals. The defeat remains Brazil's heaviest since 1920.

            Spain clinched their maiden World Cup after beating the Netherlands 1-0 in the final that had gone to extra time with Andres Iniesta scoring the winner. The tournament had many firsts with South Africa hosting it for the first time as Spain became the first nation since West Germany in 1974 to win the World Cup as European champions. The 2010 edition was made popular by the vuvuzela, a long horn blown by fans throughout the tournament.
